              <h3>How can I verify a supplier's credibility?</h3>
              <p>
                SourceBd offers several ways to verify suppliers. Look for the "Verified" badge on supplier profiles, which indicates they've passed our verification process.

              <h3>How does the shipping process work?</h3>
              <p>
                Shipping arrangements are made between buyers and suppliers. After confirming an order, the supplier will typically provide shipping options and costs. SourceBd partners with various logistics providers to offer competitive shipping rates. You can track your order through the "My Orders" section once shipping details are provided by the supplier.

              <h3>What is the minimum order quantity (MOQ)?</h3>
              <p>
                The Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) varies by product and supplier. MOQs are set by suppliers based on their production capabilities and profit margins. You can find the MOQ for each product on its listing page. If you need a quantity below the stated MOQ, you can contact the supplier directly to discuss possible arrangements.
